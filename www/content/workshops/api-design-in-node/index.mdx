## Get started building Node APIs

In this workshop, you'ill get started and learn everything you need to design and build `APIs` in Node.js from the ground up!

## Topics
By the end of the workshop, you'll learn:

- How to plan your routes and model data for real-world applications.
- How to `Create`, `Read`, `Update` and `Delete` resources from a MongoDB database with REST verb methods using Express framework routers and controllers.
- How to add authentication middleware with `JWTs`
- Finally, you'll learn to test your `APIs` with `Jest`

## Pre-requisites
- Attend my [Introduction to Node](/workshops/introduction-to-node) and [Introduction to MongoDB](/workshops/introduction-to-mongodb) Workshops, or have the equivalent basic experience of Node and MongoDB.
- A computer with an Internet connection and Google Chrome installed
