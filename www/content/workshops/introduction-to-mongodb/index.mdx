MongoDB is one of the leading open source `NoSQL` databases you can work with. It makes working with data `simple` - it's built on a philosophy that prioritizes `performance` and `efficiency`.

In this workshop, you'ill get started mastering the fundamentals of MongoDB, including MongoDBâ€™s Document data model, query MongoDB, and build CRUD API with Express. You'll learn the core concepts of `MongoDB` to build production-ready applications!

## Topics
By the end of the workshop, you'll learn:

- How to work with both the Mongo Shell and drivers (e.g. Node.js driver)
- How to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on MongoDB databases
- How to creating associations with a Nested Schema
- How to utilize `pre-save`, `pre-validation`, and `post-save` middleware.
- How to increase performance by using indexes (and how to use the right indexes!)
- How to build REST APIs using Express and MongoDB
- How to create cursor based pagination and skip limit based pagination
- and much more!

## Pre-requisites
- Attend my [Introduction to Node](/workshops/introduction-to-node) workshops, or have the equivalent basic experience of Node and MongoDB.
- A computer with an Internet connection and Google Chrome installed
