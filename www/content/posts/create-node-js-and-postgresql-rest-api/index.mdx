## Prerequisites
This guide uses installation instructions for macOS and assumes a prior knowledge of:

- [You need to have basic commands in command prompt](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-commands)
- [Basic knowledge JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)
- [Basic knowledge of application development in Node.js and NPM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/development_environment)
- [Basic knowledge PostgreSQL](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-started-with-postgresql-9d3bc1dd1b11)
- [General understanding RESTful APIs](https://pusher.com/tutorials/understanding-rest-api)

## Set Up PostgreSQL Database
We are going to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install PostgreSQL on macOS. So, make sure you install it if you haven’t done so already.
Next update the it's dependencies by running:
```bash
» brew update
```

### Installing PostgreSQL
Next, install `PostgreSQL` on the command line:
```bash
» brew install postgresql
```

It might take a little while to compile and install so be patient. Next, check your if PostgreSQL installed successfully:
```bash
» postgres --version
# postgres (PostgreSQL) 12.1
```

And then you we need to start Postgres database `server` as a background servic with the following command:
```bash
brew services start postgresql
```

### Create Our Database
We are going to create our `restfull-api-db` database that can be used for our application with the following command:
```bash
» createdb restfull-api-db
```

In order to execute SQL statements, we need to login to our database using the `psql` command:
```bash
psql restfull-api-db
```

Next, we create a `user` and `password` and give it create database access.
```sql
CREATE ROLE resful_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '1234';
ALTER ROLE resful_user CREATEDB;
```

We need to log out of from the root user by exiting from `psql` shell and then log in again but this time with to the newly created user:
```bash
# Logout from postgress shell by typing
\q

# Then login again
# -d flag is for db name, -U for postgress user
» psql -d restfull-api-db -U resful_user
```

Create a `todos` table with `ID`, and `title`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE todos (
  ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```
To get a list of all the tables in our database, we can use `\dt` command:
```sql
restfull-api-db=> \dt
    List of relations
    Schema | Name  | Type  |    Owner
    --------+-------+-------+-------------
    public | todos | table | resful_user
    (1 row)

restfull-api-db=>
```

As you see The `todos` table is the only table in our database as we just created it. In case if you want to get a closer look at the structure of `todos` table like displaying `Column Names` and `Data Types`,
you can use the following command `\d table_name,`:
```sql
restfull-api-db=> \d todos
  Table "public.todos"
  Column |          Type          | Collation | Nullable |              Default
  --------+------------------------+-----------+----------+---------------------------------
  id     | integer                |           | not null | nextval('todos_id_seq'::regclass)
  title  | character varying(255) |           | not null |

  Indexes:
      "todos_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)

restfull-api-db=>
```

Next, we populate our `todos` table with data using the `INSERT` statement as follows:
```sql
INSERT INTO todos (title) VALUES  ('Design a prototype');
INSERT INTO todos (title) VALUES  ('Organize photo shot');
INSERT INTO todos (title) VALUES  ('Bring an umbrella');
```

To view the data we just inserted, we use a `SELECT` statement as follows:
```sql
restfull-api-db=> SELECT * from todos;
  id |        title
  ----+---------------------
    1 | Design a prototype
    2 | Organize photo shot
    3 | Bring an umbrella
  (3 rows)

restfull-api-db=>
```


## Creating new Project

create a new folder there named `todos-restful-api` in root folder.
```bash
» mkdir todos-restful-api
```

### Initialize a new app.
We can initialize our app is using `NPM` or `YARN`*. To do so, first we need to `cd` into our project folder and type:
```bash
» npm init
# or
» yarn init
```

Then it asks some questions to build `package.json` file for us:
```bash
» yarn init
  yarn init v1.19.2
  question name (todos-restful-api):
  question version (1.0.0):
  question description: Node.js and PostgreSQL RESTful API
  question entry point (index.js):
  question repository url:
  question author: Ahmed Abdulrahman
  question license (MIT):
  question private: true
  success Saved package.json
  ✨  Done in 50.58s.
```

### Install Dependencies
To start with creating our express api, we are going to install the following dependencies:

- [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express): a Web Application Framework
- [PG](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) - a PostgreSQL client for Node
- [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv): a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`
- [CORS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors): enable CORS
- [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) - automatically restarts our server every time we make any change in the code.

- [express-rate-limit]() - limit repeated requests to endpoints
- [express-validator]()- string validators and santizers
- [compression]() - compression middleware
- [helmet]() - secure HTTP headers in an Express app

```bash
yarn add express pg cors dotenv
```
