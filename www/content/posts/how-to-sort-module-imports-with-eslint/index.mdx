As we know, when working on bit projects that requires a lot of components and modules to be imported. By time this gets pretty messy and unreadable, and it is really annoying to sort them manually.
Here ESLint come into play, we can enforce our editor to sort imports for us automatically. In this artcile, you‚Äôll learn how configure ESLint to imports for us automatically.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/npm/what-is-npm/)

## Installing ESLint
To install [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) globally:
```bash
npm install -g eslint
```
or we can install ESLint locally within a project:
```bash
# With NPM
npm install eslint --save-dev
# With YARN
yarn add -D eslint
```

Next, we need to create an `ESLin`t config file file (if you haven‚Äôt already):
```bash
npx eslint --init
```
## ESLint Configuration
ESLint comes with built-in [import sorting](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/sort-imports) rules and only able to sort variable names inside of multiple-imports. It considers the following to be the same type of import:

```js
import foo from 'foo';
import { bar } from 'bar';
```

So, I use [eslint-plugin-import](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import). It extends the ESLint import rules and have addional feature like
preventing issues with misspelling of file paths and import names. To install `eslint-plugin-import` plugin:

```bash
npm install eslint-plugin-import --save-dev
# With YARN
yarn add -D eslint-plugin-import
```

No rules are enforced by default. However, we need to configure them manually in ESLint config file:
```js
  //.eslintrc file
{
  .......
  extends: ['plugin:import/recommended'],
  rules: {
    'import/namespace': ['error', { allowComputed: true }],
    'import/order': [
      'error',
      {
        groups: [['index', 'sibling', 'parent', 'internal', 'external', 'builtin']],
        'newlines-between': 'never',
      },
    ],
  }
  ......
}
```
- `import/namespace`: will report at the import declaration if there are no exported names found. When imported as a full namespace `(i.e. import * as foo from './foo'; foo.bar();)` will report if bar is not exported by `./foo`.
- `groups`: sets the order intended for every [group](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import/blob/master/docs/rules/order.md).
- `newlines-between`: set to never, no new lines are allowed in the entire import section.

And that‚Äôs how one sets up autofixable import sorting with ESLint.
