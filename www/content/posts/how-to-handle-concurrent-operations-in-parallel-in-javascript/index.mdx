excerpt: Assume that you have more than one promise and you need to know when all the promises get resolved or you have to wait till all the promises resolve.

Say when a user logs into a web app, you want to get back a bunch of data and several network requests probably need to be made to in order to get the data that you want?

Then we use `Promise.all`. It takes an array of `Promises` and turns them into a single `Promise`. Once all promises get resolved, we get data back. In case of any promises get rejected it’ll be required to exit `Promise.all` early.

```js
const product = [
  new Promise(loadProduct),
  new Promise(loadPrices),
  new Promise(loadQuantity),
];

Promise.all(product)  // 👈 get em all!
  .then(response)     // 📑 data
  .catch();           // ❌ handle exception here
```

So, the main point of using `Promise.all()` is to take an array of `Promises` and turn them into a single `Promise`

Here we have another example, Notice the data in the response are ordered that is based on when the promise was “resolved.”

```js
const animals = [
  new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 200, '🦌')),
  new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 300, '🦒')),
  new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 100, '🐅')),
  new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 400, '🐘'))
];

Promise.all(animals)
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.log);
```

The result will be:

```terminal
["🐅", "🦌", "🦒", "🐘"]
```

If you would prefer using `async/await` and pure promises, this basic async/await syntax:

```js
let getFilms = async () => {
  // Get Character Info.
  let characterResponse = await fetch('http://swapi.co/api/people/1/')
  // Resolve response
  let characterResponseJson = await characterResponse.json()
  /*
    We have a list of films URLs, we can map over films URLs then wrap it
    with Promise.all() to return a single Promise.
  */
  let films = await Promise.all(
    characterResponseJson.films.map(async filmUrl => {
      let filmResponse = await fetch(filmUrl)
      return filmResponse.json()
    })
  )

  return films
}

getFilms()
```

The result will be:

```terminal
[
  { episode_id: 1, title: 'The Phantom Menace' },
  { episode_id: 2, title: 'Attack of the Clones' },
  { episode_id: 3,  title: 'Revenge of the Sith' }
]
```

To sum up, `Promise.all()` is really great when you have more than one promise in your code and you to make a concurrent operations by aggregating a list of promises to a single promise.
