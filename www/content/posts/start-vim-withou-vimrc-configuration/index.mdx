When you run vim, your `.vimrc` file gets read and executed only once. If you want to nullify and temporarily to disable your `.vimrc` without
loading any of my plugins or settings you need to, just use another environment by passing `-u` flag:

```bash
# starts VIM without initializing vimrc
vim -u NONE
```

You can also start vim with alternative vimrc file
```bash
vim -u ~/.vimrcnew
```

or if you want to start VIM without any vimrc, but with plugins
```bash
vim -u NORC
```


This is really handy when you when to record screencast showing default view of vim without deleting your config file.
