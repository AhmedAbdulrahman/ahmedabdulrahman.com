## Prerequisites
- Basic command line and bash scripting knowledge


In docker, all images are defined within special text files called **Dockerfile**, and you need to define all the steps explicitly inside that file. Let’s look at the below example:

```shell
# Pull from a base image
FROM node:12-alpine

# Copy the files from the current directory to app/
COPY . app/

# Use app/ as the working directory
WORKDIR app/

# Install dependencies (npm ci is similar to npm i, but for automated builds),
# then build production client side React application
RUN npm ci --only-production &&\
    npm run build

# Listen to the port
EXPOSE 5000

# Set Node server
ENTRYPOINT npm run start
```

Let’s split this file into lines:

- `FROM` - is the first command in the Dockerfile. Without this, we can’t build an image. It pulls the base image with the tag `12-alpine`, which is a specific version of **Node** along with specific version of Alpine.
- `COPY` - is used to copy files or directories from source host filesystem to a destination in the container file system.
- `WORKDIR` - sets the working directory for subsequent commands. We can have multiple `WORKDIR` commands and will be appended with a relative path.
- `RUN` - executes commands in a new layer on top of the existing image. Consider our example, it install npm dependencies, and build client side app with one `RUN` to avoid any additional layers.
- `EXPOSE` - is a communication between the person who builds the image and the person who runs the container so basically just sets a port.
- `ENTRYPOINT` - is used as an executable for the container. Consider our example, we are using `ENTRYPOINT` to execute `npm run start` command.


Once we have this file and named it as **Dockerfile**, we can just run this command to build our image:
```bash
docker build . -t our-image-name:our-tag
```

this will build our image and once the build is done, we can run our image with one simple command:

```bash
docker run -it our-image-name:our-tag --name webapp sh
```

This command will give us a shell **session** inside the **container**, which we can use to do whatever we want. To understand the concept a little bit better, just open another terminal **session** while
keeping the one in the container running, and run `docker ps`:
```bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                           COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
4a81c6a020c8        our-image-name:container-tag   "/bin/sh"            44 seconds ago      Up 44 seconds                           webapp
```

The one listed there is our currently running container, which we can see with the **IMAGE** column set to our new image. However, there is a small detail, if you exit the shell **session** inside the **container** by running exit or `CTRL+D`, our container will die and `docker ps` will give you an empty output. There is a simple explanation behind this behavior; when you have executed the runner
command above as:
```bash
docker run -it our-image-name:our-tag --name webapp /bin/sh
```
we have basically told **Docker** to start this container with the `/bin/sh` process as the main process inside the container, which means once your process is dead that's what happens when you exit the shell **session**,
our container will die simple as that.

We built a smiple project step by step with `Dockerfile` and looked at most of the instructions. Please look at the **Docker** docs if you need more info.
